# Wasserstein-GAN-Keras

Implementation of a Wasserstein GAN with Keras. 
Use of Anderson Darling distance and Kendall error to evaluate our model.
We can find a baseline for the performance of the model for both metrics under the 'Testing GAN' section.

This repository will be completed with better architectures and other models to improve our performance.
